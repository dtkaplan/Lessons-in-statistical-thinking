Is the argument `sat ~ frac` for `point_plot()` a *named argument*?

No. The symbol between `sat` and `frac` is a **tilde**. Named arguments always use the single equal sign: \tt{=}. Named arguments to `point_plot` include `annot =`, `tilde =`, `seed =`, `point_ink = `. 

The *first* argument to `point_plot()` is named `tilde =`. Placing `sat ~ frac` as the first argument is entirely equivalent to using the wordier `tilde = sat ~ frac`. All other arguments, however, must be referred to by name.
