One of the names appearing in @lst-GDP-mean is `mean`. 
What kind of computing object does this name refer to?

Because the name is directly followed by a parentheses, we know `mean` must refer to a function. 

Following our convention for writing function names, we should have written the name as `mean()`, but that would have made the question too easy!
