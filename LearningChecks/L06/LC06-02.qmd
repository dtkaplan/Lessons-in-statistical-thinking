:::: {.callout-tip #lck-6.2 collapse=true}
Run @lst-sat-point-error with no argument in the parentheses following `point_plot`. The resulting error message is, admittedly, cryptic. Nonetheless, scan the error message to look for something familiar that provides a clue to how you can fix the command.

Then add in the missing argument to put `frac` on the x-axis and `sat` on the y-axis.
