Use `summary()` to compute both the variance and standard deviation of the `flipper` length in the `Penguins` data frame.

```{webr-r}
Penguins |> 
  summarize(   ...variance_of_flipper...,
               ...std_dev_of_flipper...  )

```

After viewing the numbers, pipe the result into `mutate()` and do a simple calculation to demonstrate the numerical relationship between variance and standard deviation.
