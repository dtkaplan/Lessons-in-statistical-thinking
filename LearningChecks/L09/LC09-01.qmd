a. Explain why `var(height)` has units of "square-inches" when the variable `height` is measured in inches.
b. Suppose the variance of a variable `price` is 144 square inches. What is the standard deviation of `price`? (Make sure to include the units!)
c. A highway traffic monitor records the speed of vehicles passing over a spot in the road. The units of speed are miles-per-hour. But the vehicles differ in speed somewhat. What will be the units of the variance of speed?

a. When calculating the variance of a variable, we take many pairs of values, find their difference, and square them. For instance, suppose `height` includes the two values 57 inches and 54 inches. The difference between them is 3 inches. The square of this difference is 9 square-inches. The variance is the average of all the different pairs of values.
b. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance. $\sqrt{\text{144 square inches}} = \text{12 inches}$
c. Since speed is measured in miles/hour, the variance of speed will have units (miles/hour)^2^, which might equally well be written "square-miles per square hour." Admittedly, "square hour" is a strange sounding unit, but speed and the variance of speed are different kinds of things.
