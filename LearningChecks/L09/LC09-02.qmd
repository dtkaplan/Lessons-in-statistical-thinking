@lst-galton-resid-var shows how to calculate the residual for each specimen: subtract the model value from the value of the response variable. Let's look at the values of the residuals from the model of height versus sex. 

:::: {#lst-resid-point-plot}
```{r}
Galton |> 
  mutate(modval = mean(height), .by = sex) |>
  mutate(resid = height - modval) |>
  point_plot(resid ~ 1, annot = "violin")
```

a. Which line of @lst-resid-point-plot finds the residual for each of the specimens?

b. Some residuals are positive and some negative. Explain how a residual can be negative.

`r start_hint_button("Answer")`
If the model value is larger than the response variable, the residual will be negative. Similarly, if the model value is less than the response variable, the residual is positive.
`r end_hint_button()`
