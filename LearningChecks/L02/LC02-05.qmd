`r start_LC(2.5)`

When there are multiple explanatory variables, the mappings to x, color, and facet strongly influence the interpretability of a point plot. In the following chunk, based on @fig-mass-bill-species-sex2, try several different arrangements of the explanatory variables. Pick the one you find most informative. (You need only to edit line three of the chunk. Leave the response variable as `mass`.)

```{webr-r}
Penguins |> 
  point_plot(
    mass ~ sex + species + bill_length
    )
```

`r end_LC(2.5)`
