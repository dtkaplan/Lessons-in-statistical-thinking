`r start_LC(2.1)`
Fill in the names of variables in the correct place to make a dot plot like @fig-wrist-ankle but with `Waist` on the hortizontal axis and `Ankle` on the vertical axis.

```{webr-r}
Anthro_F |> 
  point_plot(..vert.. ~ ..horiz..)
```

`r start_hint_button("Hints")`
1. As you substitute the variable names in the slots named `..vert..` and `..horiz..`, make sure not to erase the tilde character that separates the names. The tilde ![](www/tilde.png) is essential. 


2. The variable named on the left-hand side of the tilde expression will be used for the  vertical axis. The right-hand side variable will on the horizontal axis.

3. Take note that both names `Waist` and `Ankle` start with a capital letter. 
`r end_hint_button()`

`r end_LC(2.1)`
