Here is a place for you to construct some graphics in order to answer the following questions.

  point_plot( ..tilde.expression.. )
```

a. Which of the variables in `apgar5 ~ eclampsia` is being jittered?

`r start_hint_button("Answer")`
`eclapsia` is a categorical variable so the data points are jittered horizontally. `apgar5` is numerical, so not jittered. Note that at each value of `apgar5` the points are arranged in a horizontal line; there is no vertical spread 
`r end_hint_button()`

b. Is jittering used when plotting `weight ~ meduc`?

`r start_hint_button("Answer")`
`meduc` is a categorical variable and therefore jittered. Weight, a quantitative variable, is not jittered.  
`r end_hint_button()`

c. Which of the variables in `induction ~ fage` is being jittered?

`r start_hint_button("Answer")`
`induction` is jittered. The data points are scattered vertically in a band around each of the categorical levels, "Y", "N", and NA.
`r end_hint_button()`
