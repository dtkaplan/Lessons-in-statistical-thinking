`r start_LC(10.02)`

Since Lesson [-@sec--variation-and-distribution] we have used the **variance** as the prefered way to measure the amount of *variation*. The advantage of the variance is that it perfectly partitions variation in the response variable into two parts: (i) variation in the model values and (ii) variation in the residuals.

The following chunk demonstrates the perfect partitioning: Run it!

:::: {#lst-resid-point-plot}
```{webr-r}
Galton |> 
  mutate(modval = mean(height), .by = sex) |>
  mutate(resid = height - modval) |>
  summarize(sd(height), sd(modval), sd(resid))
```
:::

a. Modify the above chunk to model the age of a mother (`mage`) from the `Births2022` data frame by the mother's education level (`meduc`). Is the variation in `mage` perfectly partitioned between the model values and the residuals?

`r start_hint_button("Hint")`
In addition to replacing `Galton` with `Births2022`, you will need to replace the explanatory variable `sex` with `meduc`. Similarly, replace `height` with `mage`. 
`r end_hint_button()`

b. Some people prefer to use the standard deviation (`sd()`) to measure variation. Modify the above chunk, replacing `var()` with `sd()`. Looking at the results, does the standard deviation perfectly partition the response variable into model values
and residuals?

`r end_LC(10.02)`
