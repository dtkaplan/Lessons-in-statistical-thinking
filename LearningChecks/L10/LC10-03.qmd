The `model_values()` approach to modeling works for both quantitative and categorical explanatory variables. For convenience, you can annotate `point_plot()` to show the model along with the raw data. Try it:

:::: {#lst-resid-point-plot}
```{webr-r}
Galton |> 
  point_plot(height ~ sex, annot = "model",
             # make the model easy to see through the raw data
             point_ink = 0.1, model_ink = 1)
```

a. From the graph, estimate the largest positive residual among the females.

`r start_hint_button("Answer")`
The model value for females is about 64 inches. The tallest female is 71 inches. This makes the largest residual 71 - 64 = 5 inches.
`r end_hint_button()`

b. Change the code in the chunk to show the model `height ~ mother`. Find a point that has a large negative residual from this model.
