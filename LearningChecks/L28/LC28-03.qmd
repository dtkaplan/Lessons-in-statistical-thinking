DRAFT: Applying the Bayes formula. 

We used a prior probability of 0.01 for a 50-year-old woman who goes for a regularly scheduled mammogram. Suppose, however, that a second woman gets a mammogram because of a lump in her breast. Given what we know about lumps and breast cancer, this second woman will have a higher prior, let us say, 0.05. Given a $\Ptest$ result from the mammogram, what is the posterior probability of $\Sick$.

Or, prior probability for a sports team that was no good last year, but has had an excellent first three games.

If the prior probability for the second woman is 0.05, then her prior odds are $5/95 = 0.053$. The likelihood ratio, however, is the same for both women: 9. That's because the test is not affected by the women's priors, it is about the physics of X-rays passing through different kinds of tissue. Multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood gives 0.47, a much higher posterior than the 0.083 we calculated for the woman who went at the regularly scheduled time.

Perhaps this is obvious, but it's still worth pointing out. The woman with the lump will *not* do better by waiting for the regularly scheduled time for her mammogram. Even if she does, the prior will be based on the lump.
