Statement [-@eq-sick-likelihood] describes the likelihood of observing $\Ptest$  under the hypothesis that the patient is $\Sick$: $\cal L_\Sick(\Ptest)$. We said that for mammography, this likelihood is about 0.9.

Similarly, statement [-@eq-healthy-likelihood], about $\cal L_\Healthy(\Ntest)$ is the likelihood of observing $\Ntest$ under a different hypothesis, that the patient is $\Health$. Coincidentally, for mammography, this, too, is about 0.9.

How do we know that $\cal L_\Healthy(\Ptest)$ is, accordingly, about 0.1?

`r start_hint_button("Answer")`
An observation of $\Ptest$ is the alternative to an observation of $\Ntest$, consequently, the probability of $\Ptest$ (under the hypothesis $\Healthy$) is the complement of the probability of $\Ntest$, that is $1 - \cal L_\Healthy(\Ntest) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.
