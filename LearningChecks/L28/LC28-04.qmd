REVIEW the transformation from probabilities to odds and back.

odds = p/(1-p)

p = odds/(1+odds)

THEN SHOW HOW RELATIVE strengths of belief can be formatted as odds and then transformed to the probability of one of the hypotheses (with the probability of the other being the complement).

For instance, a possible Bayesian statement about $\Sick$ and $\Healthy$ goes like this, "In the relevant instance, my belief in $\Sick$ is at a level of 7, while my belief in $\Healthy$ is only 5."
But what are the units of 7 and of 5? Perhaps surprisingly, it doesn't matter. The odds for $\Sick$ will be 7/5. Correspondingly, the prior odds for $\Healthy$ will be 5/7.
