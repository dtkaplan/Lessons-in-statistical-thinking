`r start_LC(3.1)`

The following R chunk will display just the `duration` variable from `Births2022`.

```{webr-r}
Births2022 |>
  point_plot(duration ~ 1, 
             point_ink = 0.2, 
             jitter = "y")
```

A. Which variable, if any, is mapped to the x axis? How does this correspond to the tilde expression `duration ~ 1`?

`r start_hint_button("Answer for A")`
There is no variable on the x axis, the horizontal space is used purely for jittering the dots. The R notation for "no variable" is `~ 1`. The character 1 is merely a placeholder.
`r end_hint_button()`

B. Describe the visual features that justify this statement: "Births at 40 weeks `duration` are much more common than births at 30 weeks."

`r start_hint_button("Answer for B")`
There are many more dots at `duration` 40 than at `duration` 30. Admittedly, you can't count the number of dots at 40, but you can see that the density of dots along the line is much higher at 40 than at 30.
`r end_hint_button()`

C. Let's make it a bit easier to perceive the density by jittering the dots vertically. Add the argument `jitter = "y"` to `point_plot(). Then, based on the resulting plot, answer these questions: 

i. There is a range of `duration` at which you can easily see that the density of points decreases as `duration` gets bigger. Roughly, what is that range?
ii. There is a range of `duration` at which it's hard to discern changes in density as duration increases. Again, roughly, what is that range?

`r start_hint_button("Answer for C")`
i. From about 43 weeks upward the density decreases until the dots entirely disappear near 48 weeks.
ii. The answer might depend on your computer display or eyesight, but it's fair to say that between 37 and 42 weeks, the density is more or less the same everywhere.
`r end_hint_button()`

D. It will be easier to see the structure of density within the 37-42 week band by reducing the amount of ink used for each point. Do this by changing the `point_ink` argument to a value of 0.01. To judge from the resulting graph, which single value of `duration` has the greatest number of dots?  `r short_answer(r"--(39 weeks)--")` 

Later in this Lesson we will introduce a graphical technique that makes it even easier to see even slight changes in density.
