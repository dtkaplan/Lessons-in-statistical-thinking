`r start_LC(5.61)`

In Lesson [-@sec-data-frames] we encountered `count()`, which tells how many specimens there are at each level of a categorical variable. For instance, 

:::: {#lst-galton-sex-count}
```{webr-r}
Galton |> count(sex)
```
::::

To improve your understanding of `summarize()`, re-write the calculation in @lst-galton-sex-count using `summarize()`. 

`r start_hint_button("Hints")`

i. Remember to use `.by = ` with the appropriate variable.
ii. The `n()` function, used in an argument to `summarize()`, will count the number of rows.

`r end_hint_button()`

`r end_LC(5.61)`
