`r start_LC(5.76)`



Sometimes a variable is not everything that it's claimed to be. For example, the `weight` variable in `Births2022` is described in the codebook as, "Baby's weight (in grams)." We can use wrangling to look at this more closely. Start by counting the number of times each `weight` appears in `Births2022`.

::: {#lst-weight-count}
```{webr-r}
Births2022 |> 
  count(weight) 
```
:::


THEN TRANSITION TO THIS, explaining what "mod" means.

```{webr-r}
Births2022 |> count(weight %% 10)
```

Show that most are rounded to the nearest 10 grams, some to the nearest 5. Do the others correspond to conversions from ounces to grams? 


A. But the larger weights are typically different. To see this, modify @lst-weight-count to arrange the weights in descending order. For many weights around 3000 gms, there are a hundred or more babies.

The births in `Births2022` occurred in the US, where the metric system is not widely used. Instead, pounds and ounces are used to measure weight. There are 28.35 grams per ounce.

B. Add a column named `oz` to the results in (A) with the value `weight / 28.35`.
