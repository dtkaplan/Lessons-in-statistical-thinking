Your task is to consider each of the arguments listed below in turn. First, imagine what the output from the R chunk will be by looking at the originalÂ table  [-@tbl-nats-demo] (hover over the link to see the table) and applying the `arrange()` command in your mind. Then, construct the corresponding command and compare the output to your imagined result.

```{webr-r}
Nats |> arrange( ..arguments.. )
```

[Note: These command fragments go *inside* the parentheses following `arrange`.]

i. `country`
#. `desc(GDP)`
#. `country, desc(year)`
#. `year, country`
