## Blocking

FOR EXERCISES ON BLOCKING, USE `block_by()` on real data (the background characteristics of the experimental subjects), then show that the groupwise stats are more even than they would be if pure random assignment were used.

Also, use sorting to show how quantitative variables and categorical variables are split up by block. YOU'LL Never have more than two in a row of treatment and control.

```{r}
Foo <- mtcars |>
  mutate(blocks = block_by(wt))
```
