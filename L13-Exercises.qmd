Practice with many models:

- Show that the coefficients on resids ~ explanatory are always zero.
- Calculate the R^2^



Compute the R^2^ for the model that adjusts GPA for instructor-to-instructor variation.

R^2^ goes up as more explanatory variables are added to a model, even meaningless ones.

Adjusted R^2^

MOVE THIS TO NHT chapter:
The F statistic as SNR multiplied by the amount of data per parameter. This is useful for determining whether there is some discernible signal, but not whether the signal is intelligible for any particular purpose.
