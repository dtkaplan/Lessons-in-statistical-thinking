## R^2^ and the signal-to-noise ratio

In communications engineering an important quantity is the *power* in a signal. (This is why radio stations are described technically by their output in kilowatts, a standard unit of power.) A signal-to-noise ratio is the power of the signal divided by the power of the noise.

Power is very closely related to *variance*. Taking the model values as the signal and the residuals as the noise, a signal-to-noise ratio can be written as the variance of the model values divided by the variance of the residuals.   

TURN THIS INTO A DERIVATION OF R^2^ / (1 - R^2^)
