## R^2^ and p for a categorical explanatory variable (DRAFT)

Show `R2()` and `conf_intervals()` for models with a single categorical variable.

- When there are two levels, the p-value on the coefficient is identical to the p-value on R^2^.
- When there are multiple levels, this is not true. There will, of course, be multiple coefficients, each with a p-value. The R^2^ collects together the explanatory umph of all the levels, but it also how many coefficients are used to achieve the result.
