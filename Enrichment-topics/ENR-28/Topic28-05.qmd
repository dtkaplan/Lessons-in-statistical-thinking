## Screening tests

One important use for tests such as the one we described is "**medical screening**." Screening is applied to members of the general population who display no relevant symptoms and have no particular reason to believe they might be $\Sick$. Familiar examples of tests used for screening: mammography for breast cancer, PSA for prostate cancer, Pap smears for cervical cancer. Screening also occurs in non-medical settings, for instance drug tests or criminal background checks required by employees for current or prospective workers.

The difference between screening settings and non-screening settings is a matter of degree. The number used to quantify the setting is called the "**prevalence**," which is the fraction of people in the test-taking group who are $\Sick$.
