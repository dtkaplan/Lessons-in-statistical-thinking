## Avoiding repetition 



Often, a literal display of a data frame may seem inefficient, for instance this view of the `Galton` dataframe which was constructed from @fig-galton-notebook.

```{r eval=FALSE}
Galton
```

```{r label='110-Data-frames-ieFIaK', echo=FALSE, and_so_on = "... for 898 rows altogether"}
#| label: tbl-galton-dataframe
#| tbl-cap: "The records from the table shown in @fig-galton-notebook in a data-frame format."
head(Galton, 10) 
```



It may seem that the data frame is inefficient, for example repeating the heights of mother and father for all the siblings in a family. But this view of efficiency relates to the use of paper and ink by a table; the computer entity requires a different view of efficiency.
